# Aerial-Vehicle-Detection-using-YOLO

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements an Aerial Vehicle Detection System using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. The model detects cars and other vehicles in drone-captured aerial images/videos, making it useful for traffic monitoring, surveillance, and smart city applications.

###  Objectives

Detect vehicles from aerial/drone footage.

Train YOLO on the VisDrone Dataset for improved aerial image detection.

Enhance accuracy using Transfer Learning.

###  Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch / TensorFlow

Computer Vision Tools: OpenCV

Dataset: VisDrone Dataset

Algorithm: YOLOv5 / YOLOv8



### Features

Real-time vehicle detection in aerial imagery.

High accuracy in low-resolution drone data.

Support for both image and video input.
